**After you download this source code you needed to**
- [ ] Install Python3 on https://www.python.org/downloads/
- [ ] Install requirements library, which is on requirements.txt (by using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip install -r path\to\requirements.txt`  and if you are linux user may needed to use this instead `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` or `sudo pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt` )
- [ ] Change **Username** to be your username and **Password** to be your password (in main.py file)
- [ ] Run it with just click the main.py file (You may create the short cut to your desktop) or you can run it with the fancy way by open command prompt or terminal and the `python main.py` or `python path/to/main.py`

zip file includes every thing you need to use main.py and requirements.txt 

If something went wrong please add it to Issues, I will fix it as soon as possible.
